<div>
    <p>
        Execute a script file aimed at setting an environment such as create folders, copy files, and so on.<br/>
        Give the script file path. <br/>
        You must give an absolute path (the process is executed before a SCM checkout).
        You can use the above properties variables. <br/>
        However, adding or overriding environment variables in the script doesn't have any impacts in the build job.
